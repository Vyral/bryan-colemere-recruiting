    Hi! I am Bryan Colemere, co-owner of Colemere Realty and a Third Generation
    Realtor, Colemere Realty has been selling real estate in Utah for 66 years.
    I dedicate Utah Real Estate Top Producer to all Realtors aspiring to do
    more; not only in the pursuit to earn a living, but in taking the service
    they provide their clients to the next level. Two years ago I had a vision
    to build a Real Estate Team in Utah by focusing on 2 things: First, by
    helping make each agent on my team better by offering 30 leads a month,
    weekly training, coaching, and accountability, and second, by remembering
    that our primary goal must always be to provide the best service possible to
    the clients with whom we serve! By making these our priority our team has
    tripled its number of sales over the past few years. My hope for this
    Mastermind is that it provides a community in which agents aspiring to do
    more can trade ideas, ask questions, and post concerns in and around the
    real estate industry in the Salt Lake & Surrounding areas. I want to give
    back, not only to my team, but to anyone seeking to be more.
