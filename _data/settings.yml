    Hi! I am Bryan Colemere, owner of multiple businesses in the Real Estate industry.  Being a business owner, Realtor and owner of multifamily rentals I have learned through my own experiences as well as others what it takes to run a successful and profitable business.  I believe in the principle of giving back to my community and openly sharing the principles and core values that have made us successful in a highly competitive industry. I am Third Generation Realtor for a successful brokerage that has been serving the Wasatch Front since 1953.  Together with Scott Colemere (co-owner/Broker) and Casey Hansen (Team Leader) we are passionate about helping all Realtors and business owners to do more; not only in the pursuit to earn a living, but also in taking the service they provide their clients to the next level. We know after all these years of running a successful brokerage that relationships are key, both in our community and with other local real estate agents.  My hope for these workshops, videos and strategy calls is to provide all real estate agents and business owners with the tools, systems and support to be successful.  By learning and implementing our strategies you will gain the longevity and profitable business for years to come.
