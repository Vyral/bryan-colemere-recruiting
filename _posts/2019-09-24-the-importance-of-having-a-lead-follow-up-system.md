<center><em>If you haven&rsquo;t implemented a lead follow-up system into your real estate business, you&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Over the last 66 years that our team has been in business, we’ve developed a powerful set of systems that enable us to thrive; and, now, we’d like to pass some of that wisdom on to you.

Specifically, we want to offer some insight into our lead follow-up process.

**The first thing we recommend is to utilize a CRM, like [BoomTown](https://boomtownroi.com/){: target="_blank"}**. Organizing your leads using CRM software will help you keep track of which leads you’ve recently spoken to, which leads you should nurture, and which leads are most likely to convert at a given moment, among other things. Within our own lead follow-up system, we place leads into seven categories: new, qualify, hot, watch, nurture, archive, and trash.

**It’s important to put as many people as possible into this lead “funnel.”** Doing so will give you a consistent stream of business. Of course, you’ll need to make this process as automated as possible if you want to have time to work on other areas of your business, as well. This is why lead follow-up software systems are so important.

However, it’s still important for you to do some hands-on work, like making phone calls and sending text messages. After all, you want these leads to know you’re available.

**A number of studies have shown that most leads will only convert after they’ve received between eight and 11 touches from an agent**. Calling once or twice won’t cut it. If you haven’t invested in some sort of follow-up system, you’re leaving business (and money) on the table.

Hopefully today’s message has been enlightening. If you have any other questions or would like more information about growing your business, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
