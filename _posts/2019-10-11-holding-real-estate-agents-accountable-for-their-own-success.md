One of the key things we’ve identified is that **it’s always easy to take the path of least resistance**. Every agent knows that the volume of your closings depends on how many contracts you write, which in turn depends on how many people you talk to. How many people you talk to depends on how many phone calls or conversations you have.

In that sense, real estate is not that hard, but for some reason, agents often build up the mindset that it is hard to talk to people, or that we’re too busy to do the work it takes to get contracts.

Our team has been very successful in holding our agents accountable. **Each week, we hold a one-on-one meeting with our accountability coach**. Her job is to identify the key areas in which you’re doing well, as well as the areas you can improve upon. She’ll help you track how many calls you make, the quality of your follow-ups with leads, and how many people you’re talking to.

It’s extremely difficult to hold yourself accountable, and if you don’t believe me, go ahead and try. If you can do it, I’d love to hear about your methods, because at any and all levels in real estate, I’ve seen agents struggling.

If you’d like to see how we do our one-on-ones or get a copy of our accountability matrix, please reach out to us. We’d be happy to provide that for you.
