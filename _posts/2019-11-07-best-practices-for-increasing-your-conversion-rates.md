<center><em>Today I&rsquo;ll discuss key tips to help you increase your conversion rates. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</em></center>

<br>The first thing to know about converting leads is that you’re not going to be very good at it if you don’t practice. By that, I mean **you need to practice your scripts**. Pay attention to your tonality—how fast or slow you speak plays a huge role in your ability to connect with people and to earn their trust and loyalty. If you sound unknowledgeable or aggressive on the phone, the person you’re talking to isn’t going to want to do business with you.

Who do you want to do business with? People who respect you and your time and pay you a commission that you’re worth, or someone who will beat you up the whole time and tell you that you're awful?

Next, **you should always seek out critiques** so that you can identify how you can do better. Record yourself as you make calls so you can go back and listen to them. Trust me, that might be extremely painful, but it’s better than remaining in the dark about your own shortcomings.

It might also be worthwhile to do some type of group calling effort in which you call live leads as a group. This way, someone with experience can help you as you make your calls. Practice calls are very different from actual live calls, after all. Having someone there to guide and direct you through the process of talking to leads will ultimately help you land an appointment.

That in mind, **I’m inviting you to our call hours**, which we hold four times a week. There, we call live leads as a group to help each other improve our conversion skills. If you’re interested in attending, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to have you participate so that you can improve your conversion rates and grow your business.
