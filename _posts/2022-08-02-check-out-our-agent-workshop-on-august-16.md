{% include excerpt.html %}&nbsp;<br>You’re invited to our next agent workshop\! It will be held on **August 16 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.** at the Sandy Lake Community College Campus. We’ll cover all things marketing and go into our marketing playbook. By following our tips and presenting yourself as a valuable resource to clients, you will create more business and improve your bottom line. **Here are just a few of the things we’ll talk about:**

* How to properly advertise your listings to get additional buyers
* How to advertise yourself on social media without being pushy or overbearing
* How to plan marketing events and client events so that people come to you rather than you going to them

We'd love to see you there, so if you have questions, please reach out to us by phone or email. Be sure to click here to register for the workshop.
