{% include excerpt.html %}&nbsp;<br>You’re invited to our next agent workshop\! It will be held on **August 16 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.** at the Sandy Lake Community College Campus. We’ll cover all things marketing and go into our marketing playbook. By following our tips and presenting yourself as a valuable resource to clients, you will create more business and improve your bottom line. **Here are just a few of the things we’ll talk about:**

* How to properly advertise your listings to get additional buyers
* How to promote yourself on social media without being pushy or overbearing
* How to plan marketing and client events so that people come to you rather than you going to them
