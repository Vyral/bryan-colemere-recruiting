Today we’ll answer the question, “What does an agent’s ideal schedule look like?” The answer depends on where you're at as an agent. However, here are a few tried and true principles of creating your perfect schedule:

**1\. Time block.** Set tasks for either 15-minute, 30-minute, or 60-minute segments, and remember to put them on your calendar. If they’re not on your calendar, they’re not going to happen. If you want to see an example schedule with time blocking, take a look at the attachment to this email.&nbsp;

**2\. Consistency.** Successful agents usually start their day at the same time, and they start with their biggest and most difficult tasks first. For most agents, that means making prospecting calls, follow-up calls, cold calls, internet calls, and other activities that will lead to more business in the future.

**3\. Schedule time off.** Don't forget to plan time for yourself. Real estate is a difficult business so burnout and turnover are common. You should have at least one day off in the week.
