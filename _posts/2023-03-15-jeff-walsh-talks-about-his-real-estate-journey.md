**We interviewed one of our agents, Jeff Walsh, to talk about his real estate career.** Today, heâ€™ll share what got him into the industry, the struggles he faced, and how our team is helping him become a better agent.

Before joining the real estate industry, Jeff worked for Dominion Energy Gas Company, a local utility, for about 17 years. Seeking a change and having always been interested in home sales and real estate, he decided to pursue a career change that would provide growth and challenge.

Having grown up around homebuilding and construction, he enjoyed the process but wanted to explore the other side of homes, such as sales and purchases for clients. He interviewed around 15 brokerages before choosing to join the team at Colemere Realty Associates. What set our team apart was how **we had candid discussions about the difficulties and struggles of working in real estate, rather than focusing solely on financial gains.** Jeff felt that the team had the experience to help him reach the level he needed.

Initially, he found the learning curve steep, particularly in understanding contracts and the intricacies of the real estate industry. His biggest frustration was getting clients close to making a purchase or sale, only to have the deal fall through. He also faced the challenge of working full-time for six months without receiving any compensation.

In March 2019, feeling frustrated with the lack of client progress, he took on an open house in Murray, Utah, that his colleague Brian could not attend. There, he met his first clients and their family. Jeff's greatest success was helping this family, which included six children and one with mobility issues, find a home that accommodated their needs while providing ample space.

**The environment at Colemere Realty Associates Realty is family-oriented and friendly,** with new agents being welcomed and existing agents forming friendships outside of work. We emphasize the importance of hard work and persistence in achieving success, rather than relying on a "magic pill." Jeff appreciates the ongoing coaching and mentorship that help him grow as an individual and as an agent.

Joining the real estate industry has provided Jeff with numerous opportunities and allowed him to spend more time with his family than he could in his previous career. If you have any questions for Jeff or you need help with your real estate goals, call or email us. We look forward to connecting with you.
