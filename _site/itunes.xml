Our lead generation techniques help us stay at the top. Here&rsquo;s what we do.

 

You can’t stay in business for 66 years without having some great strategies and systems in place. What drives us is simple: lead generation.

“These are just a few ways that we take advantage of powerful lead generation strategies.”

We teach our agents that there are three types of leads they should be working each day:

1. Sphere of influence. Many agents don’t put the members of their sphere into a database, and then they’re unable to contact them systematically. Without an organized approach, it’s difficult to receive repeat clients and referrals. We show our agents how to automate and use these powerful sources of business.

2. Outbound prospecting. This can be done through FSBOs, expired listings, open houses, door knocking, and simply calling around the neighborhood. We provide agents the scripts and show them how to follow up in order to convert leads into clients.

3. Internet leads. We invest heavily in online sources and teach agents how to properly connect with them, talk with them, and convert them.

These are just a few ways that we take advantage of powerful lead generation strategies; stay tuned for even more! In the meantime, If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

We&rsquo;ve been selling real estate for 66 years, so we know what it takes to have staying power in this business. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve decided to create this real estate career blog.

 

Our company has been selling real estate for the last 66 years, so we’ve recently decided to start a real estate career blog called “Utah Real Estate Top Producers.” I’ve noticed that a lot of agents have struggled in the last five to 10 years because of changing market conditions. Each month, we’re going to showcase a new topic and detail what we’ve done to become successful as a team. We’ll cover topics such as leads, lead conversion, accountability, coaching, mentorship, changing market conditions, and more.
