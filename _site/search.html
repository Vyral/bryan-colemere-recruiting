        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I&rsquo;ll discuss key tips to help you increase your conversion rates. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.The first thing to know about converting leads is that you’re not going to be very good at it if you don’t practice. By that, I mean you need to practice your scripts. Pay attention to your tonality—how fast or slow you speak plays a huge role in your ability to connect with people and to earn their trust and loyalty. If you sound unknowledgeable or aggressive on the phone, the person you’re talking to isn’t going to want to do business with you.Who do you want to do business with? People who respect you and your time and pay you a commission that you’re worth, or someone who will beat you up the whole time and tell you that you’re awful?Next, you should always seek out critiques so that you can identify how you can do better. Record yourself as you make calls so you can go back and listen to them. Trust me, that might be extremely painful, but it’s better than remaining in the dark about your own shortcomings.“Pay attention to your tonality—how fast or slow you speak plays a huge role in your ability to connect with people and to earn their trust and loyalty.”It might also be worthwhile to do some type of group calling effort in which you call live leads as a group. This way, someone with experience can help you as you make your calls. Practice calls are very different from actual live calls, after all. Having someone there to guide and direct you through the process of talking to leads will ultimately help you land an appointment.That in mind, I’m inviting you to our call hours, which we hold four times a week. There, we call live leads as a group to help each other improve our conversion skills. If you’re interested in attending, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to have you participate so that you can improve your conversion rates and grow your business.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "It can be hard to hold yourself accountable in real estate, but Colemere Realty has a system to help. One of the key things we’ve identified is that it’s always easy to take the path of least resistance. Every agent knows that the volume of your closings depends on how many contracts you write, which in turn depends on how many people you talk to. How many people you talk to depends on how many phone calls or conversations you have.In that sense, real estate is not that hard, but for some reason, agents often build up the mindset that it is hard to talk to people, or that we’re too busy to do the work it takes to get contracts.“It’s extremely difficult to hold yourself accountable.”Our team has been very successful in holding our agents accountable. Each week, we hold a one-on-one meeting with our accountability coach. Her job is to identify the key areas in which you’re doing well, as well as the areas you can improve upon. She’ll help you track how many calls you make, the quality of your follow-ups with leads, and how many people you’re talking to.It’s extremely difficult to hold yourself accountable, and if you don’t believe me, go ahead and try. If you can do it, I’d love to hear about your methods, because at any and all levels in real estate, I’ve seen agents struggling.If you’d like to see how we do our one-on-ones or get a copy of our accountability matrix, please reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you haven&rsquo;t implemented a lead follow-up system into your real estate business, you&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice. Over the last 66 years that our team has been in business, we’ve developed a powerful set of systems that enable us to thrive; and, now, we’d like to pass some of that wisdom on to you.Specifically, we want to offer some insight into our lead follow-up process.The first thing we recommend is to utilize a CRM, like BoomTown. Organizing your leads using CRM software will help you keep track of which leads you’ve recently spoken to, which leads you should nurture, and which leads are most likely to convert at a given moment, among other things. Within our own lead follow-up system, we place leads into seven categories: new, qualify, hot, watch, nurture, archive, and trash.It’s important to put as many people as possible into this lead “funnel.” Doing so will give you a consistent stream of business. Of course, you’ll need to make this process as automated as possible if you want to have time to work on other areas of your business, as well. This is why lead follow-up software systems are so important.“If you haven’t invested in some sort of follow-up system, you’re leaving business (and money) on the table.”However, it’s still important for you to do some hands-on work, like making phone calls and sending text messages. After all, you want these leads to know you’re available.A number of studies have shown that most leads will only convert after they’ve received between eight and 11 touches from an agent. Calling once or twice won’t cut it. If you haven’t invested in some sort of follow-up system, you’re leaving business (and money) on the table.Hopefully today’s message has been enlightening. If you have any other questions or would like more information about growing your business, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

What drives us is simple: lead generation.We teach our agents that there are three types of leads they should be working each day:1. Sphere of influence. Many agents don’t put the members of their sphere into a database, and then they’re unable to contact them systematically. Without an organized approach, it’s difficult to receive repeat clients and referrals. We show our agents how to automate and use these powerful sources of business.“These are just a few ways that we take advantage of powerful lead generation strategies.”2. Outbound prospecting. This can be done through FSBOs, expired listings, open houses, door knocking, and simply calling around the neighborhood. We provide agents the scripts and show them how to follow up and convert leads into clients.3. Internet leads. We invest heavily in online sources and teach agents how to properly connect with them, talk with them, and convert them.These are just a few ways that we take advantage of powerful lead generation strategies; stay tuned for even more!

			<p>Hi! I am Bryan Colemere, co-owner of Colemere Realty and a Third Generation Realtor, Colemere Realty has been selling real estate in Utah for 66 years. I dedicate Utah Real Estate Top Producer to all Realtors aspiring to do more; not only in the pursuit to earn a living, but in taking the service they provide their clients to the next level. Two years ago I had a vision to build a Real Estate Team in Utah by focusing on 2 things: First, by helping make each agent on my team better by offering 30 leads a month, weekly training, coaching, and accountability, and second, by remembering that our primary goal must always be to provide the best service possible to the clients with whom we serve! By making these our priority our team has tripled its number of sales over the past few years. My hope for this Mastermind is that it provides a community in which agents aspiring to do more can trade ideas, ask questions, and post concerns in and around the real estate industry in the Salt Lake &amp; Surrounding areas. I want to give back, not only to my team, but to anyone seeking to be more.</p>
