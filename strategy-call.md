<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent: </p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes? </p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate. </p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you). </p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money. </p>

<p>My name is Bryan Colemere and I’ve sold 1023 homes to date. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes. </p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes. </p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc.), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you. </p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach. </p>

<p>Why am I offering this? </p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage. </p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest. </p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too. </p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting. </p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Bryan Colemere</p>
